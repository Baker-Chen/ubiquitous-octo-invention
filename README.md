In the post pandemic era, zero-contact technology has become a trend. Among them, the elevator is beneficial to the spread of the virus, because the elevator space is small, closed and crowded. It is easy to infect because people contact the elevator control panel and talk to each other in the elevator. So we wanted to achieve a smart elevator control panel that can recognize the specific gestures and always-on system through the benefits of Himax WE-I Plus ultra-low power consumption and AI acceleration, and reduce operation complexity and overall power consumption through a distributed computing architecture of edge computing.
